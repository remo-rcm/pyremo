Installation
------------

You can install the package directly from github using pip:


.. code-block:: console

    pip install git+https://github.com/remo-rcm/pyremo


If you want to contribute, I recommend cloning the repository and installing the package in development mode, e.g.


.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/remo-rcm/pyremo
    cd pyremo
    pip install -e .


This will install the package but you can still edit it and you don't need the package in your :code:`PYTHONPATH`
